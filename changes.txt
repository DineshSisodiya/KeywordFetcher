1. performance improved
2. trie computation is saved in file 
   only computed if level3 keyword file changes
3. ignoring comma may leads to change so many things almost the whole concept.this is producing so many errors. it's better to handle it letter.
   it will require more time to think on it again.
4. new functions added - fetchById() for single post or array
